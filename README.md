# Puzzled HangMan
This game is a different version of the original HangMan game. To start the game, you must first select a category and that will generate random word within that selected category. If the correct letters are selected then the middle screen will begin to reveal an image pertaining to that secret word. On the other hand, if an incorrect guess is made, your number of guesses will diminish. If the game is won, an image will appear at full opacity but, if maximum number of incorrect guesses are made, the losing message will appear on screen and image will disappear.
